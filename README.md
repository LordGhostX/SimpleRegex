# Simple Regex

A library built to automate the most commonly used regular expressions.

Well I've got this issue with regular expressions and it's that I suck at writing them (well this is because I never really gave time to master them). When faced with problems that are meant for regular expressions, I just find other ways of solving them or a quick google search for a solution.

So I just decided to write a library that automates the most common usage of regular expressions in Python like extracting and validating emails, phone numbers and all the basic stuffs...
